## 2024-05-18 - Input Fields UX and A11y Links\n**Learning:** Using `autoComplete="email"` and `spellCheck="false"` along with correct `name` attributes significantly reduces friction in forms. Skip-to-content links combined with a focusable target (`tabIndex={-1}`) provide robust keyboard accessibility without affecting normal tab flow.\n**Action:** Add these attributes as standard to all new forms and layout components.

## 2024-05-18 - Form Submission Focus Management
**Learning:** When a form successfully submits and the original component containing the submit button unmounts to show a success message, focus drops to the body, losing keyboard and screen reader context.
**Action:** Always implement focus management to shift focus to the new success state container (using `tabIndex={-1}`) or refocus the input on validation errors.
